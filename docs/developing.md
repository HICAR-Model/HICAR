##Developing
Users are encouraged to modify ICAR for their own specific purposes, and to make those changes available for others by submitting them back to the main repository.  The ICAR code base have been set up to make some additions (e.g. a new physics package) very easy to add, and the developers will do their best to work with anyone who wishes to add more sophisticated changes.  

It is worth reading a discussion of the [git workflow](howto/icar_git_workflow.md) used with ICAR.  

Then there is a description of [how to work with git and ICAR](howto/icar_and_git_howto.md).  

For an outline of the basic code structure see the [ICAR code overview](icar_code_overview.md)

For a more complete documentation of ICAR, see the [detailed ICAR code description](http://ncar.github.io/icar/).  This full description is being updated as the doxygen markup is added to the code.  It also has detailed interactive diagrams of the inter-relationship between all functions.  For the overview, start by looking at the [documentation for the main program](http://ncar.github.io/icar/driver_8f90.html).
