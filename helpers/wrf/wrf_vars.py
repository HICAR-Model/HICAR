import operator as op

#  note, the elements of wrfvars must either be strings, operators, numbers, or lists. 
#   lists will have their elements loaded one by one
#   strings will be treated as variable names to load from the file
#   operators will cause the next element to be loaded operated on with the last element
#   numbers will simply be used as is. 
#   
# Example : ["P",op.add,"PB"] means that the variable "P" will be loaded, then the variable "PB"
#           the result will be stored in variable "P" in the output file.
