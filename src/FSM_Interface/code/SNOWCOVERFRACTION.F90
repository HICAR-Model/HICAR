  ! reads SWE amounts from previous model runs, and calculate dswe in as difference between the minimum in the previous days to current swe
  ! This has three SCF regimes: 
  ! (1) scf_season calculated with swemax (for the topographic dependent standard deviation (Helbig et al., 2015)), swemin (for the nominator in the tanh function) 
  ! (2) scf_nsnow calculated with a SWE amounts of previous model runs and the current swe (SWEbuffer), swemin_buffer is the minimum in this buffer, 
  !     swemax_buffer is the maximum from the minimun to current. These values are used to calculate dswemax (for standard deviation, here Egli and Jonas 2009 is used 
  !     to account for new snow is behaving more like a flat field) and to calculate dswe (for the nominator in the tanh function). 
  ! (3) scf_nsnow_recent ensures that pixels with a SWE history have similar new snow SCF as pixels which were bare and not less. Here dswe_recent is used for both standard
  !     deviation (as well Egli and Jonas, 2009) and nominator, no dswemax_recent. Here the most recent minimum is searched in the SWEbuffer
  ! Snowfalls during melt may add variability. This is accounted for with Jan's idea of backwards re-calculating swemax with current swe. This swemax is the value as if
  !     this current swe would have been reached with melting only and no intermediate snow falls. cf. the 'ireset' part.
  ! The maximum of the three SCF regimes is used to calculate the final SCF. This is Jan's great idea to ensure that during the ablation period a new snow fall is adding significantly
  !     to the SCF, but allows to fall back to similar SCF values when this new snow has melted away. dswe used for scf_nsnow can be interpreted as if the last snowfall would fall on bare ground. 
  !     After melting away (i.e. scf_nsnow<scf_season), the SCF will switch from scf_nsnow to scf_season
  ! Important is that swemax, swemin is used without settling, i.e. on SWE and not HS. Also important is that Helbig's and Egli's standard deviations are calculated on HS.
