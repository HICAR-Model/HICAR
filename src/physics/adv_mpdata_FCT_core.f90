! For Reference, this is the core 1D implementation of mpdata included earlier in the code from adv_mpdata_core.f90
!
! It is stored in a separate file so that the same code can
! be used for advect_u, advect_v, and advect_w after l, r, etc. are set up
! 
!     ! First Calculate the standard upwind advection
!     call flux1(l,r,U2,f)
!
!     ! q1 is a temporary array to store the data while working with it here.
!     q1(1)=l(1)
!     q1(n)=r(n-1)
!     q1(2:n-1) = l(2:n-1) + (f(:n-2) - f(2:n-1))
!
!     ! This is the MPDATA diffusion correction term for 1D flow
!     ! U is defined on the mass grid for the pseudo-velocities?
!     ! left and right pseudo (diffusive) velocities
!
!     ! we will copy the q1 data into r to potentially minimize aliasing problems
!     ! for the compiler, and improve memory alignment for vectorization
!     r  = q1(2:n)
!     ! l  = q1(1:n-1) ! no need to copy these data over again
!
!     ! In MPDATA papers (r-l)/(r+l) is usually refered to as "A"
!     ! compute the denomenator first so we can check that it is not zero
!     denom=(r + q1(1:n-1))
!     where(denom==0) denom=1e-10
!     ! U2 is the diffusive pseudo-velocity
!     U2 = abs(U2) - U2**2
!     U2 = U2 * (r-q1(1:n-1)) / denom
!
!     ! now calculate the MPDATA flux term
!     call flux1(q1(1:n-1),r,U2,f)

! Fluxes are added to the original scalar field in the advect_u and advect_v subroutines

! This is the Flux Corrected Transport option described in : 
! Smolarkiewicz and Grabowski (1990) J. of Comp. Phys. v86 p355-375

! for now at least this is in a loop instead of vectorized.  I'm not sure how easy this would be to vectorize. 
    do i=1,n-1
        ! first find the min and max values allowable in the final field based on the initial (stored in l) and upwind (q1) fields
        ! min and max are taken from the grid cells on either side of the flux cell wall to be corrected
        if (i==1) then
            ! l still equals q0
